# FedShare - Federated Learning Framework

## Overview
This is a federated learning research project implementing four algorithms:
- **FedShare**: The main algorithm with privacy-preserving features
- **FedAvg**: Classical federated averaging algorithm  
- **SCOTCH**: Another federated learning approach
- **DPSShare**: Differential Privacy with Secret Sharing (enhanced 2025-10-02) with full security implementation including PoW, digital signatures, validator committee, and fog node authentication

The project is built with Python 3.11, TensorFlow 2.20.0, and Flask for the web interface.

## Usage
The project runs on port 5000 with an enhanced web interface featuring:
- Real-time training progress tracking
- Interactive algorithm execution
- Live log viewing
- Performance metrics visualization

Access the web interface at the main URL. Click buttons to run algorithms directly from the browser.

## Technical Setup
- **Frontend**: Enhanced Flask app (`enhanced_app.py`) on port 5000 (bound to 0.0.0.0)
- **Backend**: Distributed federated learning clients and servers
- **Configuration**: 5 clients, 3 servers, 3 training rounds, batch size 16
- **Dataset**: MNIST (6,000 samples for faster training)
- **Deployment**: Configured for VM deployment target

## Files Structure

- `DPSSHARE_ALGORITHM.md` - Comprehensive documentation of the DPSShare algorithm with CP-ABE, differential privacy, secret sharing, and committee validation mechanisms
- `dpsshare_security.py` - Security module implementing PoW, digital signatures, validator committee, and fog node authentication
- `dpsshareclient.py` - DPSShare client with integrated security features
- `dpsshareserver.py` - DPSShare fog nodes with validator committee and regional aggregator role

- Optimized for fast training iterations in development environment
- Production deployment configured for VM target
- Configuration: 5 clients, 3 servers, 3 training rounds, 6K dataset samples

## Technical Fixes Applied
- **Flask Debug Mode**: Fixed debug=False and use_reloader=False in fedavgserver.py and fedavgclient.py to prevent nohup conflicts
- **Memory Optimization**: Added TensorFlow threading limits (OMP_NUM_THREADS=1, TF_NUM_INTRAOP_THREADS=1, TF_NUM_INTEROP_THREADS=1) to prevent OOM issues
- **Configuration Simplified**: Reduced to 1 client, 1 server, 1 training round, 2000 dataset size for stability testing
- **Python Interpreter**: Standardized Python executable usage in shell scripts
- **Process Coordination**: Improved startup delays and error handling in start-fedavg.sh
- **Health Check Endpoints**: Added root "/" endpoints to all federated learning clients (fedshareclient.py, fedavgclient.py, scotchclient.py) to resolve 404 errors during health checks that were causing algorithms to get stuck at 25%
- **DPSShare Algorithm (2025-10-02)**: 
  - Replaced numerically unstable Shamir Secret Sharing (polynomial-based with large coefficients) with additive secret sharing
  - Fixed extreme loss values (was ~10^15, now ~0.38) and low accuracy (was 9%, now ~89%)
  - Optimized differential privacy parameters (epsilon=5.0, sensitivity=0.01) for better utility while maintaining privacy
  - Eliminated mathematical errors where weighted averaging was incorrectly applied to polynomial shares
  - **Enhanced Security Features (2025-10-02)**:
    - Implemented Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism for Sybil attack prevention
    - Added digital signature authentication for all client shares
    - Integrated validator committee with consensus voting (3 validators, majority required)
    - Fog nodes now explicitly assume regional aggregator role after validation
    - Leader server verifies fog node signatures before global aggregation
    - Complete security chain: PoW → Digital Signatures → Committee Validation → Fog Aggregation → Global Aggregation
